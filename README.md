# Sample basic social media dataset
This repository is here for people who needs random social media data for some data manipulation, experimentation and data analysis.
This dataset is made of 6 CSV files (6 tables).

# Tables description

## User table
This table has been generated by using the website https://www.mockaroo.com/
It's pretty convenient and fast create fake data as long as you don't more than 1000 rows.
The rest of the tables will be generated with python script since there is some logic and connection to them.

## Friendship table
This table contains information about user and their friends ID (or the person they follow). 
This script has been code assuming that the friendship in this social media in uni-directional, you can be friend with someone, but the person is not necessarily friend with you. It's more similar to Instagram or Twitter than Facebook in that sense.
